1. Declare/discuss any aspects of your code that are not working. What are your intuitions about why things are not working? What issues you already tried and ruled out? Given more time, what would you try next? Detailed answers here are critical to getting partial credit for malfunctioning programs.

Write your response here
So far, everything in our code is working as intended, although it did take us a long time to get it working properly. Initially, we created a very inefficient height method which also needed a helper method. I wish we implemented the correct method sooner because the incorrect height method was really slowing us down.



2. In a few sentences, describe how you tested that your code was working.

Write your response here
We did gradle test, to run our program. In terms of detailed testing, we utilized the printTree() method in the test files to see what was the issue. We could see if rebalance, insert, or the rotation methods were working correctly. 


3. What was the most challenging aspect of this assignment, and why?

Write your response here
Understanding the fact that AVL Trees are essentially linked lists with three-pointers. Once I understood that, I was able to figure out how the rotations work as well as insert. 


4. What variant/extension of this assignment would you like to try (e.g., a variant that is more powerful, more interesting, etc).

Write your response here
I don't understand what is meant by variant/extension. But I would like to do something a little more interesting. 


5.If you did the enhancemets, explain what you did, how you did it, and instructions for testing your enhancements.

Write your response here
We did no enhancements
