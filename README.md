# AVL-Trees
Implemented BST & AVL Tree operations.

1. Implement BST (not AVL) insert and search functionality.
2. Implement leftRotate and rightRotate helper methods to perform a rotation on a given node.
3. Implement rebalance to fix a violation of the AVL property caused by an insertion. Keep height updated.
4. Implement avlInsert to maintain AVL balance in the tree after insertions using the rebalance method.
5. Implement the avlUnique method in Unique.java, which must run in O(nlogn).
